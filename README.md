## My process

Started off importing all the necessary images/colors/fonts into tailwind. Then did some basic component mapping. After I finished mapping all the components, I started with the mobile design. Then I did the desktop design before moving onto the active states. Finally, I finished with the mobile menu.

### Built with

- HTML5
- Tailwind-CSS
- React-JS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned more about linear-gradients/background-images and what contain, fill, cover, fit do.

### Continued development

I would like more practice with the useState hook as well as creating larger websites.
